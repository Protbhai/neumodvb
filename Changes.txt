Changes in version neumodvb-0.7

-------------------
Positioner related

-More consistent layout of positioner dialog. Disable some functions when unusable

-Fixes for diseqc12, e.g., new diseqc12 value not stored when user updates it

-Positioner bug fixes: send diseqc switch commands before sending any positioner command;
 report better error messages in GUI; properly handle continuous motion.

-Send diseqc switch commands before spectrum scan to avoid scanning the wrong lnb

-Prevent dish movement during mux scan

-Satellite is now only shown as "confirmed" (no question mark) if the position was actually
 found in the NIT table.

-Positioner dialog: show SNR and constellation even when tuner is not locked

-Avoid interference between positioner dialog and mux scan

-Disallow starting positioner dialog from some screens, when context does not allow guessing which
 lnb the user wants to use

-In positioner dialog allow negative SNRs. Yes, there are muxes which lock with a negative SNR!

-Documentation of positioner commands

-Allow rotors which can rotate by more than 65 degrees. The old code used to cause a goto south
 in this case.

-------------------
Scanning related:

-Mux tables now show the source of the mux information. For instance if the frequency
 was found in the NIT table or rather from the tuner and if sat position was guessed or
 found in NIT

-Improved handling of bad data while scanning muxes:
   0 frequency (7.3W 11411H) or other nonsensical values;
   contradictory information in muxes from 0.8W and 1.0W;
   invalid satellite positions;
   on 42.0E, muxes are being reported as from 42.0W;
   some muxes report AUTO for modulation
   incorrect polarisation reported in C-band reuters mux on 22W;
   incorrect polarisation reported on 7.3W 11411H
   22.0E 4181V and other muxes which claim QAM_AUTO in NIT

-Fixed incorrectly reported roll-offs (may require driver update)

-Correctly handle some cases where mux or blindscan never finish

-Remove "scan-in-progress" data from database at startup to avoid an old scan from
 restarting when neumoDVB is restarted

-Improved handling of muxes reported on nearby satellites (e.g., 0.8W and 1.0W). Avoid creating
 duplicates in this case. The downside is that when scanning e.g., 0.8W the found mux may
 appear in the list for 1.0W and thus confuse the user

-Fixed incorrect display of scan status on mux list when mux scan is in progress

-Fixed bug where incorrect pls_code and pls_mode was retrieved from driver

-Correctly save DVBS2 matype in the database and do not show this value for DVBS

-Fix incorrect lock detection

-When scanning multistreams: retain tuning info when scanning next stream

-Spectrum blindscan now moves faster to the next candidate peak when mux does not contain
 a DVB stream


-------------------
t2mi related:


-Fixed corruption in t2mi streams. This requires a patched tsduck as well.

-Improved handling of non-t2mi DVB-T service information on DVB-S muxes. Avoid entering
 such muxes as DVB-T

-correctly handle duplicate packets in transport streams; tsduck needs to be patched
 to also handle t2mi streams correctly

------------
GUI related

-Handle some corruption in service and mux list

-Various GUI improvements.

-Changed key-binding for activating edit-mode.

-New "status list" screen shows which adapters are active and what they are doing

-Fix some crashes when ending program

-Fix some errors when service list is empty

-Allow user to select a stream_id even when dvb streams reports incorrectly that stream is not multistream

-Correctly update recordings screen when database changes

-Minimum RF level shown on live screen is now lower than before

-Fixed some issues with list filtering


------------
Other

-Fixed some bugs in the code used to look up muxes. For instance, in rare cases a mux with
the wrong polarization was returned

-Fixed bug: lnb offset correction was applied in wrong direction on C band

-Detection of whether dish needs to be moved was sometimes incorrect; database now contains
 the ultimate truth on this.

-Fixes to support ubuntu 20.04

-Fixed race between closing and then reopening the same frontend, which caused sporadic assertions.

-correctly release lnb in more cases then before: when user closwes window; when spectrum blindscan
 finishes

-various other bugs
